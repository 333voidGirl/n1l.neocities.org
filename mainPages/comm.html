  <h4>General Commission Info & Terms</h4>
    <p>The terms and info listed here fall under each category of commission alongside their own terms and info</p>
    <p>
    Although it's preferable that you dm me on Instagram to talk about commissions, you can also contact me through email or Discord. You can find all that info <a href="/mainPages/socials-contact.html">here</a>.
    <br>
    Final products will be sent through email to ensure the highest quality files can be sent, so I will be asking for your email eventually.
    <br>
    Send me the links to anything you use my work for so that I can inspect and share it.
    <br>

    <h4>Beat/Music Commission Info & Terms</h4>
    <p>
    <b>Pre-made beats</b> can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15O-r8XW_u5EFA3w4WWc4Yps52JYXIifx?usp=sharing">here</a> for <b>$20 each</b>.
    <br>
    <b>Custom-made beats/music</b> can be bought for <b>$40 each</b> with examples <a href="https://soundcloud.com/voidandnil/sets/prod-me">here</a> for custom beats and on any of my music platforms for custom music.
    <br>
    Credit must be given under most circumstances. On sites like SoundCloud, BandCamp, and YouTube (for songs) I would prefer for credit to be given in the title ((for example, (prod. 333voidgirl) or (333voidgirl), etc...)) but crediting me within the description is also fine, especially if you link to my <a href="https://soundcloud.com/voidandnil">SoundCloud</a>; you can use either 333voidGirl, 0::n1l, or ARRRVO when crediting me. Credit is not needed for songs going on Spotify and other streaming platforms, but if you'd like to credit in the title that'd be great. If you're commissioning me for background music on a YouTube video or something similar, credit me in the description. If you're commissioning me for game music or anything else not mentioned previously, we can discuss credit one-on-one.
