As you've probably noticed, everything about the site has changed. I hope you all enjoy the new layout and find it easier to maneuver than the previous version(s). I probably will not be reposting any of the elder blog posts and some sections may be added later on, but the major layout likely will not change for a while. The <a href="https://github.com/333voidGirl/n1l.neocities.org"></a> repo contains all the site's code and images and is licensed under the GPL 3.0; I encourage use of the code to help build any projects you want especially if you're just learning HTML and CSS. Special thanks to <a href="https://nyx.land">Nyx</a> who I have -admittedly- taken a lot from; including but not limited to <a href="https://b0x.neocities.org/media/background2-flip.gif">this gif from b0x</a> and the link color from Nyx.Land.

Risen from its own ashes, comes forth <a href="https://arv0mastersite.neocities.org">arv0mastersite</a>! ARRRVO is still dead, but the site has been revived from a simple redirect <a href="https://n1l.neocities.org">here</a> to an archive of some old things I want to keep up but also off-site (so far just the <a href="https://arv0mastersite.neocities.org/art/posts/human/layer1">Human?</a> piece). If anything worthwhile is removed from here, it'll likely end up there.

The Xxtarlit doc archives are temporarily not linked anywhre I'm in control of, but will be posted sometime soon. I will probably not continue working on it, it's far too draining and a bit traumatic still, but I will make sure both versions of the docs are archived and easily available as best I can. It's still up-in-the-air as to whether or not the archive will be hosted here on the blog or on arv0mastersite, but it'll be up regardless and I will make a post here once it is. TLDR; Xxtarlit doc coming sometime soon, and she's an <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Nine_Angles">O9A</a>-loving (at least emotionally) manipulative & abusive rightoid who gets kids into DXM abuse; don't give her your money or time.
