<h1>Revisiting the Xxtarlit Doc: An Investigation into Grooming & the Order of the Nine Angles</h1>
<br>
<h2>Preamble</h2>
<p>
This is a revisiting/rewriting of a document written just last year to call out musician & artist Xxtarlit & is meant as a continuation & revisal of the original document. The original is difficult to find & has a lot of language I am not proud of -like calling people schizo & drug-addicted, which is not the way this type of thing should be handled. The original versions can be found here (uncensored) & here (censored). This paper will contain references to/images of self-harm, drug-abuse, lolicon, fascism, Satanism/spiritualism/religion, etc. Per Medium‚Äôs TOS, any photos shown will be censored.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Introduction to Nia</h2>
<p>
Nia -better known as Starlit or Xxtarlit & perhaps best-known for her work Fleeting Frozen Heart- is a musician & artist, as well as an autistic trans-woman who practices Satanism -& I believe a system, though I do not know & don‚Äôt want to accidentally misrepresent her or any individual with DID or anything similar. Her musical work is largely a combination of hexD, breakcore, drum & bass, & trance; with her visual art & aesthetic largely coming from Satanism & anime/chibi. She was also previously on the label Dismiss Yourself -where some of her merchandise & music was released- & runs the collective REDLIXXXGHTS. A host of events led to myself & some others creating an expos√© on her, which had been largely ignored & even ridiculed by her & her fans, associates, etc; although, it did result in her getting booted from Dismiss Yourself. Here is a recounting of that.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Introduction to the Paper, its Author, & its Contents</h2>
<p>
Sometime in mid/late 2021, I had learned about Xxtarlit & had started listening to her music. With an already blossoming love of the aesthetics & genres associated with &/or made by Nia -& as a practicing Satanist/Luciferian/Demonologist/whatever-you-wanna-call-it- I quickly found myself in Nia‚Äôs Discord server & was communing quite frequently with everyone there. Obviously as an autistic transfemme with an interest in practicing Satanism & in making breakcore, drum & bass, & hexD music; Nia & I started getting along well together & we became, ostensibly, friends. I, as somebody who at the time particularly was pretty lonely & in a weird spot with a lot of my relationships, moving around, etc., was more than happy to be talking to Nia whenever she was available. We had much in common, even insofar as our names -Nil & Nia- being opposites -Void & Light- & our astral parents being one & the same -Lucifer & Lilith. We took a liking to each other, as well as each other‚Äôs art & music, & pretty soon I was in REDLIXXXGHTS, gaining access to an extra hidden channel in her Discord server. Our sisterhood, as we called it, was very strong -but the cracks slowly grew.
<br>
I dissociated through much of those few months I was associated with Nia; the only things I entirely remember are sleepless nights & dissociated schooldays traveling through astral dimensions to visit her, staring at multiplicities of 3 anywhere I could find, & becoming slowly paranoid. I was very likely developing/going through psychosis during that time; I remember being intensely worried I was becoming schizophrenic. At some point I had realized the root cause of it all, & realized a lot of the things I had been seeing. A few other concerned individuals & I decided to cut ties with Nia, as well as try to prevent more people from falling into what we had fallen into. The document, originally released by SadToThe as the least vulnerable amongst us, was -admittedly- rushed & sloppy, but it served to get the word out somewhat. Somewhat wasn‚Äôt enough however; the main attention it got was from O9A-affiliated trolls (O9A being Order of the Nine Angles) & people essentially dickriding Nia -& Nia essentially brushed it off without any major outrage outside of being made fun of on Dismiss Yourself‚Äôs Discord server. I see people talking about her in a bad light on occasion, with people typically surprised to learn she‚Äôs a fascist, but it never really got much steam & I far more often see clueless breakcore fans praising her music. It seems now she has made her Discord server a Patron-only venture, with it being a reward for chucking $3 (a month) at her Patreon -probably the only major effect the doc had on her- but nothing much else has changed. This paper will attempt to dive deeper into the accusations previously described in the document, as well as get it to a much further audience than an obscure Archive.org PDF ever could. I‚Äôm sure I will get hit hard by O9A affiliates/‚Äúmembers,‚Äù possibly even harder than SadToThe was when he initially posted the documents on Twitter, but I won‚Äôt back down.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Order of the Nine Angles, Tempel ov Blood, Fascism, & Racism</h2>
<p>
The Order of the Nine Angles (O9A or ONA)is an originally-UK-based Satanic & Left-Hand Path occultist group. To quote Wikipedia‚Äôs descriptions of its beliefs:
<br>
<i>
The ONA promotes the idea that human history can be divided into a series of aeons, each of which contains a corresponding human civilization. It expresses the view that the current aeonic civilization is that of the Western world, but it claims that the evolution of this society is threatened by the ‚ÄúMagian/Nazarene‚Äù influence of the Judeo-Christian religion, which the Order seeks to combat in order to establish a militaristic new social order, which it calls the ‚ÄúImperium‚Äù. According to Order teachings, this is necessary in order for a galactic civilization to form, in which ‚ÄúAryan‚Äù society will colonise the Milky Way. It advocates a spiritual path in which practitioners are required to break societal taboos by isolating themselves from society, committing crimes, embracing political extremism and violence, and carrying out acts of human sacrifice. ONA members practice magic, believing that they are able to do it by channeling energies into their own ‚Äúcausal‚Äù realm from an ‚Äúacausal‚Äù realm where the laws of physics do not apply, and these magical actions are designed to help them achieve their ultimate goal of establishing the imperium.
</i>
<br>
Although many ‚ÄúNiners‚Äù -as they are called- may disagree with Wikipedia‚Äôs definitions & summaries of their group -& furthermore with my definitions of them- they are a Neo-Nazi group, & have been continually agreed by investigators & reporters to be as such. They have continuously been affiliated with Neo-Nazi organizations such as Atomwaffen Division & Iron March, & their community both online & in real life have been, very obviously, Neo-Nazis.
<br>
Also related is their sister-organization, the Tempel ov Blood (ToB). The O9A officially disown the ToB, but most Niners you‚Äôll find online also associate themselves with & read the works of the ToB. The Tempel ov Blood‚Äôs most popular works are Iron Gates & Liber 333 (not to be confused with Crowley‚Äôs book of the same title, which will be referenced specifically as Crowley‚Äôs Liber 333 henceforth); the former essentially being a rape & pedophilia-fetish rant with some apocalyptic Nazi-Satanist fluff thrown everywhere; & the latter being a collection of writings by the ToB largely containing sets of Nazi-worshiping rituals & their mission statement, which reads:
<br>
<i>
[‚Ä¶] we wish to hold as our highest priority the creation of the New Being. The realization of the meaning of the human‚Äôs life is this ‚Äî humans are nothing in themselves, they are great however once they have decided to become a bridge to the New Being variously described and symbolized by Homo Galactica, Ubermensch, Noctulians, Vampires, and the various titles given to Alien beings in such mythologies. ANY and ALL humans who fail to embrace this evolutionary urge will serve as food and a resource to be used by the New Being- as a human would a lesser animal. Thus is our philosophy and way of being a terror to the Magian. So much sweeter will their Blood Essence be to consume‚Ä¶
</i>
<br>
Also in the ToB‚Äôs Liber 333 is this -which I hope helps you grasp just how ingrained Nazism is in ToB & O9A worship (& also as an aside, would be quite funny if this shit did not get people hurt):
<br>
<i>Image here</i>
<br>
How does this all tie back to Nia? Well, while I was first becoming initiated with Demonology more closely I spoke a fair amount in Nia‚Äôs server & with her, & one of the things they showed me while asking about Choronzon -a demon or spirit originally by Crowley- was ToB‚Äôs Liber 333 (also note: two emojis in her server are the ToB & O9A sigils -will return to that later; Kuro is/was Nia‚Äôs boyfriend; I am the blurred out/censored individual).
<br>
<i>Image here</i>
The connection that Nia had to obvious Nazi worship should be in & of itself very obvious -even without mentioning the ToB & O9A emotes- but it gets deeper when investigating Kuro. Kuro, as previously mentioned, is/was Nia‚Äôs boyfriend during my time in her server -I‚Äôll assume he still is so I don‚Äôt have to keep saying was/is- & was probably one of the most bold about his affiliation with the O9A & Nazism generally. Before we get all the way there, though, I need to introduce Vesna.
<br>
Vesna was in the server for a brief period -probably about a month at most- & was characterized almost entirely by their association with the O9A, as shown here:
<br>
<i>Image here</i>
<br>
Vesna & Kuro were pretty tight in the server, & often conversed a lot about the O9A. Here‚Äôs a short bit of a conversation on the O9A involving Nia, Kuro, Vesna, & some others.
<br>
<i>Image here</i>
<br>
This conversation & its thesis is already ironic given what we‚Äôve gone over, but it gets even worse when investigating Kuro & Vesna even further.
<br>
On one occasion a previous member of the server (who would like to remain anonymous & will be called Anon1) called out Kuro & Vesna for using Nazi iconography & symbolism, which then caused them to be harassed by members of the server for various personal things. Here is a summary of that:
<br>
<i>Image here</i>
<br>
The conversation continued in Anon1‚Äôs & Kuro‚Äôs DMs:
<br>
<i>Image here</i>
<br>
As if Kuro‚Äôs apathy towards Nazis & towards learning about Nazi dogwhistles wasn‚Äôt bad enough, they listen to National Socialist Black Metal (NSBM for short, literally Nazi Black Metal):
<br>
<i>Image here</i>
<br>
Here are some additional Kuro moments that fit in this section, but that I couldn‚Äôt fit anywhere else:
<br>
<i>Image here</i>
<br>
Investigating further into Vesna -the individual who said the O9A isn‚Äôt a Nazi group is also telling. While I still believed Nia didn‚Äôt fully know about the Nazism in the O9A & ToB (ie. while I was still being emotionally groomed -inadvertently or not- into being very attached to Nia), I joined some O9A Discord servers found through sites like Disboard (of note; these server-finders have a really bad Fascist problem, particularly Disboard) & began investigating into what their communities were like. If you‚Äôre curious about that, it was a lot of really edgy Isis beheading videos, really unfunny & honestly shocking racism, & more stuff that thoroughly traumatized me & probably kick-started an episode of psychosis. Vesna was in one of the servers I investigated, & I attempted to log some of their behavior & tell Nia about it.
<br>
<i>Image here</i>
<br>
I believe all of the previous messages were left without a response from Nia.
<br>
Nia also has had a habit of associating with & harboring non-black people who say the N-word (she blames not moderating the server on being nocturnal, by the way), as well as saying it herself:
<br>
<i>Image here</i>
<br>
Here‚Äôs an excerpt of a big thing that went down where a white person said the N-word, & multiple people had to complain to get them kicked. The individual with the Otonashi Ayana profile picture (Anon2) is black, Dekoro (the user with the Japanese name & the greyscale pfp) is not. Note that Kuro didn‚Äôt care the whole time:
<br>
<i>Image here</i>
<br>
There‚Äôs nowhere I can think to put this, but here is some screenshots of Nia & Kuro talking about the Sonnenrad (a symbol invented by Nazis, regardless of what is said online about its origins):
<br>
<i>Image here</i>
<br>
There are some other examples, such as users with 1488 in their Discord tags & users (that same user, actually) rambling about how women should be raped being friends with Nia on Discord, but I don‚Äôt have those screenshots anymore.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Self-Harm Glorification, DXM Abuse, & Grooming</h2>
<p>
<b>A quick aside before I begin this section:</b> Nia has had a long history with self-harm, beginning before any affiliation with the O9A or Satanism. I want to say, first & foremost, that Nia engaging in self-harm is not her fault & that blood magick is not in & of itself a bad practice. The same goes for Nia doing DXM (Dextromethorphan) both recreationally & as a magickal practice. Nia clearly fell into an addiction with self-harm & DXM abuse & that is not the issue, the issue is her glorification of it & grooming others into doing the same.
<br>
I was already pretty dissociated & lonely around the time I started talking to Nia, as I previously mentioned, & I was pretty willing to go with whatever as long as it meant I got to talk to her. This is a small bit from one of our initial conversations:
<br>
<i>Image here</i>
<br>
Nia groomed a lot of people into self-harming, including myself. Also of note is that, once in REDLIXXXGHTS, you would be given a special role in Nia‚Äôs server (characterized by a red color & an inverted pentacle/pentagram) & would be given access to a channel in her server called ‚ÄúHELL‚Äù. In that channel people mostly post self-harm photos & talk about self-harming, & there was at least one other 17 year-old in that channel (including myself) that was clearly being groomed into self-harming. Regrettably, I have no screenshots of that channel.
<br>
Here is one example that an anonymous user (Anon3) came forth to tell us after the document was originally pubished as a Google Doc (it was shut down for gore, & we republished on Archive.org after adding Anon3‚Äôs story). It also includes Nia sexually grooming Anon3 & grooming them into doing DXM, which we will touch on soon:
<br>
<i>Image here</i>
<br>
DXM is a very easily legally obtainable dissociative which Nia was hooked on for ~3 months (don‚Äôt quote me on the timing). She spoke about it a lot during the time she was addicted & dependent on it. A lot of the advice she gave was actually good drug advice (eg. get DXM with no other ingredients because it is deadly), but she mostly was just telling a bunch of really vulnerable lonely minors who looked up to her to do hard drugs.
<br>

</p>
<br>
<h2>Lolicon</h2>
<p>
An emoji in Nia‚Äôs server is a reference to a Lolicon meme (Uohhhhhhhhh):
<br>
<i>Image here</i>
<br>
And she has talked about cunny (little girl pussy) a few times.
<br>
<i>Image here</i>
<br>
The original document contained a screenshot on Nia being/joking about being an age-regressor, which is not in & of itself a bad thing, so I will not comment on it here.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Conclusion (Humanizing)</h2>
<p>
After some time spent talking to other people who were concerned with Nia‚Äôs behavior & wanted to leave, I decided to message Nia about everything one final time before fully leaving her behind. I felt, & still do feel, that a lot of what happened wasn‚Äôt entirely her fault. She, like I am, is a highly autistic trans-woman with nowhere to really seek refuge. The O9A, as hateful as it obviously is, serves as an ‚Äúout‚Äù for people like that, drawing us in with aesthetics & hatred of the societies that hate us. Obviously, the racism & hatred is entirely wrong & is inexcusable, but I think a big part of what draws people into that type of environment is hatred coming from every other direction. Maybe I‚Äôm suffering from Stockholm Syndrome & trauma blurring my thoughts, but I feel like much of what Nia did could be explained -not excused- by that kind of isolation & how she was also probably groomed into being that way. Here are our final messages before finally split off from her forever:
<br>
<i>Image here</i>
<br>
I suppose if I have a thesis, this would be it:
<br>
People like Nia -& furthermore people like me- are still people; we didn‚Äôt ever deserve to be ostracized for existing & the fact it happened is deeply regrettable. Nia probably couldn‚Äôt ever redeem herself because of her own actions, but we should be protecting people like her before they start doing things like she did. People should be warned about these online spaces, organizations like the O9A, & about Nia in her current state. Do not support Nia, her art, or her music.
