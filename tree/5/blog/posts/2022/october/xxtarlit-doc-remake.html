Hi all. I have remade the <a href="https://archive.org/details/copy-of-xxtarlit-starlit-exposed/" target="_blank">Xxtarlit callout document</a> for a variety of reasons (which I discuss in the remake). If anyone reading this blogpost is unfamiliar with her actions I would highly suggest you check out the new version available via <a href="https://medium.com/@voidandnil/xxtarlitdoc2-d0d0d51966f9" target="_blank">Medium</a>. Please share the word if you can.

That would be the end of the story if the post didn't get deleted. Turns out calling out literal Nazis & their communities for a variety of things is "Targeted Harassment" according to Medium, & the only way I can get that post back on there is by scrubbing everyone's names out -which is obviously something I am not going to do. So -instead of that- here is every single place you can find the doc remake uploaded by me!
