This is the official GitHub repo for my website. I figured I'd put it on here for cool internet points, to possibly help other people learn web development, to track my progress, & get help from anyone nice enough to throw any my way.
The whole site is under the GPL 3.0, and all blogposts and art are under CC BY-SA 4.0.
