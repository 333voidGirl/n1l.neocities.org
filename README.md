I've decided to upload my site to GitHub for cool internet points & to make the code easier for anyone to access if they want to. The whole thing is really fucking messy because I am an absolute novice but I figure it's better than having to inspect element everything if anyone else is new & wants to learn from my site. If you'd like to help me with anything, I welcome commits! You can find the site online https://n1l.neocities.org/
