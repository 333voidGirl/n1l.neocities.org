<p>Well, today's finally the day; ARRRVO is officially dead in the water. I have been thinking about killing it off for a long time, but today ARRRVO enters into the realm of 333 other dead aliases & you will be a megafan in a decade if you remember Arvo or ARRRVO (& if you remember Pearl Brown the Rat Queen or RAZURSTATIC, you should be put on a watchlist)! Why is it dead? Well, it's plainly just dumb to have multiple different artist names for music that I know is going to be so similar. 333voidGirl & ARRRVO were seperated originally as the former was newly created to do some dark trap & techno stuff, whilst the latter had already been forming its NDAD/Machine Girl-esque sound for a few years. But, eventually, I realized that whenever that ARRRVO self-titled album came to fruition it was going to sound a lot like a 333 album, & that it wasn't worth seperating projects anymore. I decided to shut down ARRRVO rather than 333 because 333 has simply been more recognizable, & it was going to be a lot easier to keep going under it. It still feels a <i>bit</i> like a corny internet name to me sometimes, but 333voidGirl has been the consistent heading alias for a while now & it is a lot more recognizable than the millions of Arvos out there (which was why the RRR & all-caps gimmick began existing, by the way). Even if I kill off 333voidGirl eventually, it will likely just be n1l or 0::n1l, which are already names associated with 333 & my whole brand generally. I will be shutting down the ARRRVO Spotify at some point soon & moving all the songs to the 333 Spotify. ARRRVO has been in purgatory for ages, & it's only right that I finally put her to rest.
