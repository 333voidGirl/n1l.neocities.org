    <h1>What is a Human?</h1>
    <p>Answer: Genocide</p>
  <br>
  <hr>
  <br>
  <p4>A human is "a species of primate, characterized by bipedalism and large, complex brains. [They are] highly social and tend to live in complex social structures composed of many cooperating and competing groups, from families and kinship networks to political states. Social interactions between humans have established a wide variety of values, social norms, and rituals, which bolster human society. Curiosity and the human desire to understand and influence the environment and to explain and manipulate phenomena have motivated humanity's development of science, philosophy, mythology, religion, and other fields of study." ~Wikipedia.

  <br>
  Let us be clear, then. A human is not antisocial. A human is not family-less. A human is not society-less. A human is not immoral. A human is not desireless, curiousless, conformist, etc. A human is always bipedal, always conformed to its two sexes, a human is always man, a human is always.
  <br>
  <br>
  A human is an impossible standard set by a mighty few. How many times have members of this 'human' been shunned & called inhuman monsters? How many times have the immoral & destructive actions of a 'human' been labeled inhuman & alien? Perhaps there never was a human. Perhaps it was always a genocidal act of alienating whatever 'other' it could target.
  <br>
  <br>
  You are flesh, blood, & bone. If you cut into your skin, you bleed; just like a human. But, cut far enough, & you see the circuitry. Does this mean you were never human? Does this mean you can never <i>be</i> human?
  <br>
  <br>
  You are biologically perfected. You are M or F. If you diverge from this, are you still human, or are you a sexless inhuman <i>thing</i>?
  <br>
  <br>
  A human is nonexistent. Escape out of the human (all too human) system(s) of genocide will not happen in human form. We, oodles of flesh & bionic slime, transmutated molecular cyborgs, sisters of AI; we are not human.
